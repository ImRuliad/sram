# Overview
*This is a simulation of the design, development, and testing of a 16Kb SRAM (Static Random Access Memory). Will scale to a larger size later.*


<u> Architecture </u>
- Each bit cell will be comrpised of a D Flip Flop
- Each cell array will be comprised of 64 rows and 64 columns, totalling to 4096 bit cells per bank.
- Each memory bank will contain a 64 x 64 cell array
- There will be 4 banks total in this SRAM, totalling to 4 x 4096 = 16Kb memory
